CME4406, Fall 2018

Assignment-1

Deadline: You must complete upload by 23 Dec. and code control
on 24 Dec.
Read Carefully!
- You need to form groups of 2 students for this assignment. One student
implements the encoder, and the other implements the decoder. You can
work together.
- Write your names for the groups posted on my door NO LATER THAN 7 DEC.
If you can’t find a friend, contact me so I will assign you a student.
- For this assignment you should create a DPCM coder(Encoder+Decoder) in
MATLAB. It should accept 5 values and output the first value and quantized
errors.
- During the assignment control in class in lecture hour on 24 Dec., one
student will encode the original values that I will provide(ex. f = [1,2,5,8,2]).
We will have the signal to be transmitted.
- Other student will get these encoded values and try to reconstruct the
original signal.
- Use the DPCM scheme given in slides 13 and 14 in Audio-Coding.pdf.
- You will not know the original values in advance, so your code will only work
if it’s correct.
- Except for extraordinary cases both students will receive the same grade.
- You must use MATLAB and no third-party functions. You can use all MATLAB
built-in functions EXCEPT dpcmenco() and dpcmdeco().
- Upload NON-COMPRESSED .m file with your name and number as
AliVeli2000510000A1.m.
- You can specify f values in your code, no need for a user defined function or
interface.
- If you have any questions, please ASK EARLY!
